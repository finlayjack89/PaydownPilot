Brand Specification: "Resolve"Core Identity: "The Science of Debt Freedom."Design Philosophy: "The Blueprint."The UI should feel less like a standard SaaS dashboard and more like a high-end engineering tool or flight deck. It prioritizes clarity, data precision, and calm authority over "gamification." It replaces anxiety with mathematical certainty1111.1. Visual Design System (Tailwind CSS)A. Color PaletteWe use a "Dark Mode First" approach 2 to reduce eye strain and increase the perception of seriousness.Backgrounds (The Canvas):bg-slate-950: Main app background (Deep, void-like).bg-slate-900: Card/Panel backgrounds (Elevated surfaces).border-slate-800: Subtle borders to define structure without visual clutter.Primary Action (The Resolver):text-cyan-400 / bg-cyan-500: Used for the "Math Brain" actions (e.g., "Generate Plan" button, active timeline paths). Represents cold, hard calculation.Secondary/Intelligence (The Researcher):text-amber-400 / border-amber-500/50: Used specifically for the "Language Brain" (AI) interactions3. When the system finds a lender rule or explains a plan, it glows Gold to signify "illumination/insight."Status Indicators:Success: emerald-500 (Subdued green). Used for "Payoff Date" markers.Critical: rose-500 (Coral red). Used for "Constraint Violation" or "Missed Payment."Neutral: slate-400. Used for secondary text.B. TypographyPrimary Font: Inter or system-ui. Clean, legible, invisible.Data Font: JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono.Crucial: All monetary values (balances, payments, interest) must be rendered in a monospace font. This subtly reinforces that the numbers are precise outputs of the deterministic solver4444.C. Shape & FormRadius: rounded-sm or rounded-md. Avoid fully rounded "pill" shapes. Keep corners slightly sharp to emphasize precision.Borders: Thin, 1px borders. High contrast (slate-700) is preferred over drop shadows to maintain a "flat/technical" look.2. UI Component Styling (The "Skin")The "Ledger" (Formerly "Accounts List") 5Visual Style: Render accounts as "Data Cards" rather than a simple list.Header: Rename "Accounts" to "The Ledger."Styling:Each card has a thin left-border strip indicating its status (Cyan for active, Emerald for paid off).Balances are large, white, and monospace.AI Integration: If a rule was found by the AI6, add a small Gold badge: [Verified Rule].The "Control Panel" (Formerly "Budget & Strategy") 7Visual Style: Technical toggles and sliders.Strategy Selection: instead of a dropdown, use large "Option Cards" with icons.Avalanche (Min Interest): Icon of a downward jagged line.Snowball (Cash Flow): Icon of a shield.Promo Hunter: Icon of a target/scope.The "Resolution" (Formerly "Dashboard/Timeline") 8Chart Styling:Use thin lines (2px) for the debt trajectory.The "Zero Debt" line should be a bright, dashed Horizon line that anchors the chart.No soft gradients or 3D effects. Flat, clear lines.The "Assistant" (Chat Interface) 9Visual Style: Distinct from the rest of the app.Appearance: A side panel or overlay with a border-amber-500/30.Avatar: Do not use a robot face. Use a simple geometric symbol (like a Spark or a Hexagon) to represent the "Language Brain."3. Tone of Voice & Micro-Copy (The "Dictionary")Replace standard SaaS jargon with terms that fit the "Resolve" determination theme.Standard Term"Resolve" Brand TermReasoningApp NameResolveDetermination + Mathematical Solution10."Add Account""Add Liability" or "Update Ledger""Liability" is the accurate financial term; sets a serious tone."Submit""Verify"Used for data entry.

Implementation Notes for ReplitWhen creating the tailwind.config.ts, use this extension:TypeScripttheme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      background: '#020617', // slate-950
      surface: '#0f172a',    // slate-900
      border: '#1e293b',     // slate-800
      primary: {
        DEFAULT: '#06b6d4',  // cyan-500 (The Optimizer)
        foreground: '#ffffff',
      },
      intelligence: {
        DEFAULT: '#f59e0b',  // amber-500 (The Researcher)
        dim: 'rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.1)',
      },
      success: '#10b981',    // emerald-500
      alert: '#f43f5e',      // rose-500
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      mono: ['JetBrains Mono', 'monospace'], // Critical for financial data
    }
  }
}
Workflow Preservation:The user flow remains exactly as defined in the PRD14:Onboarding ->Ledger Entry (with AI "Researching..." states) ->Parameter Setup (Budget/Strategy) ->Resolve Plan (Click button) ->Resolution Path (View Results).The only change is the skin and the labeling of these steps.
