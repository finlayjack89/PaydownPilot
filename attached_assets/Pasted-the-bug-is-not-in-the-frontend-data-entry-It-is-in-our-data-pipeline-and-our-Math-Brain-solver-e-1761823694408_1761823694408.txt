the bug is not in the frontend data entry. It is in our data pipeline and our "Math Brain" (solver_engine.py).

After tracing the code with this new evidence, I have found two distinct, critical bugs.

Bug 1 (P0): The "TODO" Data Bug
The primary bug that is causing the $0.00 payment is in client/src/components/add-account-dialog.tsx.

In the handleSave function, the minimum payment rule is hard-coded to 0 and is not reading from the form state. The code you provided (commit f786e7db...) has TODO markers where this logic should be.

File: client/src/components/add-account-dialog.tsx Lines: 188-190

TypeScript

// CURRENT BUGGY CODE
const accountData = {
  // ... other fields
  minPaymentRuleFixedCents: 0, // TODO: Get from form
  minPaymentRulePercentageBps: 0, // TODO: Get from form
  minPaymentRuleIncludesInterest: false, // TODO: Get from form
  // ... other fields
};
Why this causes the bug:

You are saving $0 and 0% to the database for every account, regardless of what you type in the form.

The server/routes.ts file reads this 0 data from the database.

It passes fixed_cents: 0 and percentage_bps: 0 to the solver_engine.py.

The "Math Brain" correctly calculates final_minimum_payment_var as max(0, 0) = 0.

The constraint payments[key] >= 0 is applied, and the optimizer correctly assigns a $0 payment to the lower-APR "Amex Blue" card to prioritize the higher-APR "Chase" card.

Contradiction Note: Your screenshots are in direct conflict with this code. Screenshot 1 (14.19.53.jpg) shows the correct rules, but the code in add-account-dialog.tsx (commit f786e7db...) makes it impossible to save those rules.

This means you are running a version of the code where lines 188-190 are fixed. You must ensure this fix is applied.

Assuming you are running a version where that is fixed, there is a second bug that your "Amex Blue" test case exposes.

Bug 2 (P1): The "Math Brain" Logic Flaw
This is the deeper bug you've found. Even after you fix Bug 1, your "Amex Blue" card's minimum payment will still be wrong.

The bug is in solver_engine.py. The logic for calculating a minimum payment that includes interest is flawed.

File: solver_engine.py (commit f786e7db...) Line: 392

Python

# CURRENT BUGGY CODE
if min_rule.includes_interest:
    # ... (Correctly calculates interest_for_min_payment_var)
    # ... (Correctly calculates percent_plus_interest_var)

    # THIS LINE IS THE BUG:
    model.AddMaxEquality(
        total_min_var, [fixed_min, percent_min_var]
    ) 
    # It uses 'percent_min_var' (just the 1%)
    # It SHOULD use 'percent_plus_interest_var' (the 1% + interest)
else:
    model.AddMaxEquality(
        total_min_var, [fixed_min, percent_min_var]
    )
Why this is a bug:

For your "Amex Blue" card, the rule is max(fixed, % + interest).

The code correctly calculates % + interest and saves it as percent_plus_interest_var.

But when it calculates the max, it forgets to use that variable. It uses percent_min_var (which is just the %) instead.

Trace:

fixed_min = $25.00

percent_min_var (1% of $2,500) = $25.00

interest_for_min_payment_var = $39.56

percent_plus_interest_var = $25.00 + $39.56 = $64.56 (This is the correct value)

Buggy AddMaxEquality runs: total_min_var = max(fixed_min, percent_min_var)

Result: total_min_var = max($25.00, $25.00) = $25.00.

This bug means the solver thinks the minimum payment is $25, not the correct $64.56.

This explains why the minimum is not respected. The system is enforcing a $25 minimum. The reason it's $0\ in your screenshot is due to Bug 1.

Your Action Plan
Fix Bug 1 (P0): Modify client/src/components/add-account-dialog.tsx to correctly read the minimum payment values from the form state when saving.

Fix Bug 2 (P1): Modify solver_engine.py on line 392 to use the correct variable.

Here is the code for the solver_engine.py fix:

Python

# In solver_engine.py
if min_rule.includes_interest:
    # ... (lines 382-390 are correct) ...

    # --- START FIX ---
    model.AddMaxEquality(
        total_min_var, [fixed_min, percent_plus_interest_var]
    )
    # --- END FIX ---
else:
    model.AddMaxEquality(
        total_min_var, [fixed_min, percent_min_var]
    )
After you fix both of these bugs, the system will:

Correctly save the "Amex Blue" rule to the database.

Correctly calculate its minimum payment as $64.56.

Correctly enforce payments['Amex Blue'] >= 64.56 in the plan.
